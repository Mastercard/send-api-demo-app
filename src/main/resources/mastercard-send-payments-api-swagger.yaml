        You must provide a unique `paymentReference` value. The success (201)
        response will contain a system-generated `paymentId` value and the
        status (`transactionStatus`) will indicate whether the transaction was
        approved. If the status is 'PENDING', see [Transaction Responses with a
        'PENDING'
        Status](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-send-2-0/documentation/response-error-codes/pending-response/).

              The `governmentIdUris` field can contain an array of data strings,
              which each identify a Government ID number for the Recipient.
              Construct each data string using the following properties and
              values. Start with `schema:id-number` and append subsequent
              `property=value` couplets using a semi-colon (;) separator.

              * schema = A 3-character alpha code identifying the type of
              Government ID. Valid values:

              alpha-numeric characters, including special characters hyphen (-)
              and forward slash (/), for example F/4611211-234.

              <br>For a Social Security Number, the value should be 9 digits
              only.

              * expiration-date = The expiration date for the Government ID, in
              ISO 8601 full date format (YYYY-MM-DD). For example, if the date
              is 30 March 2050, the value is 2050-03-30.

              <br>If the Government ID type expires in a particular month
              (rather than on a specific day), populate the date as the first or
              last day of that month (whichever is appropriate).

              * issue-date = The issuing date for the Government ID, in ISO 8601

              January 2008, the value is 2008-01-31.

              <br>The issuing date cannot be a future date. If the Government ID
              type was issued in a particular month (rather than on a specific
              day), populate the date as the first or last day of that month
              (whichever is appropriate).

              * issuing-country = The 3-character ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country
              code representing the country that issued the Government ID; see
              [Country and Currency
              Codes](https://developer.mastercard.com/mastercard-send-2-0/documentation/field-uris-codes/country-currency-codes/).

              * issuing-place = The name of the place (city, state or province)
